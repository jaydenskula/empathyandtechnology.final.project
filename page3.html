    <h4>Goals</h4>

    <h4>Methods</h4>
        <p>
            I created a very brief questionnaire online and posted it on two social media sites. I asked people to participate and share it with others to get more data.
            I stated that the survey was about self-reported empathy, and informed people that the data collected would not be used for any purposes outside of this project.
            For truthful and unbiased responses, I put the questions about depression and antidepressant medication at the very end of the survey.
