    <p>
        Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. The number of people diagnosed 
        with depression has been rising steadily the past few years. So, why would this have an effect on empathy? Research suggests that having depression can
        decrease one's empathy. At the same time, however, depression also has the possibility to increase someone's empathy. There are three types of empathy:
        <b>cognitive empathy</b>, <b>affective empathy</b>, and <b>empathic concern.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Whether someone's empathy is inhibited or boosted by major depressive disorder changes between peoples. Most studies claim that major depressive disorder causes
        a decline in empathy.

    <p>
        Even though most claims posit depression as the cause for lower empathy, I believe that depression can increase someone's empathy due to the structure 
        of the depressed brain.
