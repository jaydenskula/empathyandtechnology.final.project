    <p>The second part of my project deals with emotional granularity. Emotional granularity is the ability to identify different emotions. As someone who is active in some online communities, I was curious if people have been increasing their range of emotions due to the digital age. Many phrases and various slang have arose from the existence of the internet and online communities and people are finding more and more ways to express themselves and their emotions.
       As stated before, I am fairly active in some online communities. So, for this portion of my project I have composed a list of phrases, "words", and other slang that I've seen people use online to express strong emotions.
